In this repository we use numerical methods for the analysis of the followings:
- 1D wave equation
- Time Dependent Diffusion Equation
- Time Independent Diffusion Equation

The numerical methods explored in this first assignment will be:
- Jacobi iteration
- Gauss-Seidel method 
- Successive over relaxation
